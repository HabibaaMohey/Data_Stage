# Data_Stage
 ETL solution to load and transform data into data marts based on specific business needs, enabling valuable insights for our organization


First, Building the "RETAIL_DATA_MART" 

 - Our first goal is to construct a data mart that displays each transaction for customers based on their type: "citizen" or "foreign". Additionally, we will include product information and details of the stock purchased. To achieve this, we will read the source data, perform necessary transformations, and save the resulting data mart.

Next, we will focus on the "ACTIVATIONSALES_DATA_MART". By leveraging the data mart created in  first case , we will address the following business needs:

✅ Displaying the count of all transactions for each employee in each store.

✅ Identifying the customer type that generated the maximum profit. 

✅Based on the customers' profit generation, we will provide them with a bonus.
